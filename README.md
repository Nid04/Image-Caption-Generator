# Overview #
Image caption generation is a task in which a machine learning model is trained to generate natural language descriptions of an image. 
The goal is to create a model that can understand the content of an image and generate a caption that accurately describes it. 
There are several techniques that can be used for image caption generation, including neural networks and deep learning. 
One popular approach is to use a convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract features from the image, and a recurrent neural network (RNN) to generate the caption. 
Once the model is trained, it can be used to generate captions for new images.
