# Overview #
Image caption generation is a task in which a machine learning model is trained to generate natural language descriptions of an image. 
The goal is to create a model that can understand the content of an image and generate a caption that accurately describes it. 
There are several techniques that can be used for image caption generation, including neural networks and deep learning. 
One popular approach is to use a convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract features from the image, and a recurrent neural network (RNN) to generate the caption. 
Once the model is trained, it can be used to generate captions for new images.

# Project Context & Scope #
The context for an Image Caption generation using AI/ML project is to automatically generate natural language descriptions for images.

The scope of this project will include the following steps:

* Collecting, cleaning and preprocessing a dataset of images and their corresponding captions.
* Design and implement a model for image caption generation.
* Train the model on the dataset.
* Evaluation of the model on the dateset.
* Optimizing the model.
* Integartion of the model with the main application.

The main objective of our project is to generate captions that accurately describe an image.

## High-level Requirements ##

The high level requirements for an Image Caption generation using AI/ML project are:

* Dataset of an image and it's caption: It will be helpful to train and evaluate the model. The large dataset will help to evaluate the relationship between the image and it's caption and can generalize the images as well.
* ML model: The model will extract feature and generate caption based on the feature.
* Development environment: It includes the hardware & software which will help to train, evaluate & optimize our model
* Evaluation & tuning of model
* Integration of model with large system or an application
